https://hub.docker.com/_/nextcloud
A safe home for all your data. Access & share your files, calendars, contacts, mail & more from any device, on your terms.

Using an external database
By default this container uses SQLite for data storage, but the Nextcloud setup wizard (appears on first run) allows connecting to an existing MySQL/MariaDB or PostgreSQL database. You can also link a database container, e. g. --link my-mysql:mysql, and then use mysql as the database host on setup. More info is in the docker-compose section.

Persistent data
The Nextcloud installation and all data beyond what lives in the database (file uploads, etc) is stored in the unnamed docker volume volume /var/www/html. The docker daemon will store that data within the docker directory /var/lib/docker/volumes/.... That means your data is saved even if the container crashes, is stopped or deleted.

A named Docker volume or a mounted host directory should be used for upgrades and backups. To achieve this you need one volume for your database container and one for Nextcloud.
/var/www/html/ folder where all Nextcloud data lives

$ docker run -d \
-v nextcloud:/var/www/html \
nextcloud

Database:

/var/lib/mysql MySQL / MariaDB Data

/var/lib/postgresql/data PostgreSQL Data

$ docker run -d \
-v db:/var/lib/mysql \
mariadb

If you want to get fine grained access to your individual files, you can mount additional volumes for data, config, your theme and custom apps. The data, config are stored in respective subfolders inside /var/www/html/. The apps are split into core apps (which are shipped with Nextcloud and you don't need to take care of) and a custom_apps folder. If you use a custom theme it would go into the themes subfolder.

Overview of the folders that can be mounted as volumes:

/var/www/html Main folder, needed for updating
/var/www/html/custom_apps installed / modified apps
/var/www/html/config local configuration
/var/www/html/data the actual data of your Nextcloud
/var/www/html/themes/<YOU_CUSTOM_THEME> theming/branding
If you want to use named volumes for all of these it would look like this

$ docker run -d \
    -v nextcloud:/var/www/html \
    -v apps:/var/www/html/custom_apps \
    -v config:/var/www/html/config \
    -v data:/var/www/html/data \
    -v theme:/var/www/html/themes/<YOUR_CUSTOM_THEME> \
    nextcloud
