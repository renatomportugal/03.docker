For a MySQL database you can link an database container, e.g. --link my-mysql:mysql, and then use mysql as the database host on setup.

ownCloud is a self-hosted file sync and share server.

ownCloud is a self-hosted file sync and share server. It provides access to your data through a web interface, sync clients or WebDAV while providing a platform to view, sync and share across devices easily—all under your control. ownCloud’s open architecture is extensible via a simple but powerful API for applications and plugins and it works with any storage.

Persistent data
All data beyond what lives in the database (file uploads, etc) is stored within the default volume /var/www/html. With this volume, ownCloud will only be updated when the file version.php is not present.

-v /<mydatalocation>:/var/www/html
For fine grained data persistence, you can use 3 volumes, as shown below.

-v /<mydatalocation>/apps:/var/www/html/apps installed / modified apps
-v /<mydatalocation>/config:/var/www/html/config local configuration
-v /<mydatalocation>/data:/var/www/html/data the actual data of your ownCloud

docker exec -u www-data some-owncloud php occ status

Example stack.yml for owncloud:

# Database user: root
# Database password: example
# Database name: pick any name
# Database host: replace "localhost" with "mysql"
